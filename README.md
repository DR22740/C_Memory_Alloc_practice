# C_Memory_Alloc_practice
An alternative to malloc from C just to practice C
It is a program made just as a practice to how C memory allocation works.
IMPORTANT NOTES
since sbrk is sensitive to what operating system this program is run on - this specific program was run on Linux WSL and it should work on Ubuntu Linux too.
Not suitable for windows execution.
Main file should print out some info in console - to demonstrate the program
